## About the project

### 1. Data Module.
Creates a dataset of twitch stream frames by downloading
frames from livestreams in popular categories.
![data](/images/data.png)
Uses **Streamlink** to download frames, **OpenCV** to resize images,
**sqlalchemy** to store info in a **postgres** database.

### 2. Model Module.
Trains a CNN model with the downloaded dataset using tensorflow.
![model](/images/model.png)
Comes with a model trained on 2.5 GB of 240x240 images (2700 per
category).

## Requirements
* Python 3.6â€“3.8
* cuDNN 8.0
* CUDA 11.0

## Install

### Clone the repository and install the requirements:
```
git clone https://github.com/molokhovdmitry/TwitchCategory
cd TwitchCategory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Setup the application by filling *config.py*
Default model training settings work with:
* 16 GB of RAM
* GTX 1660Ti

## How to use
### Data
Create and download the dataset with:
```
python -m data.download
```
To stop the downloading process press *Enter* in the terminal.

To show the dataset info and list the downloaded categories use:
```
python -m data.info
```

You can synchronize the database with the dataset after deleting games/frames from
the dataset with:
```
python -m data.dbSync
```

### Model
Train a model with the downloaded data with:
```
python -m model.create
```
This will create **model.h5** and **classes.txt** files.

### Recognition
Recognize stream category with:
```
python -m recognition.recognize login
```
